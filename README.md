# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

> I'm using Font awesome for icons in this but i had my Font awesome directory included in .gitignore so if you wanna run this project
> you should dowload your Font-awesome kit into src/assets or replace the 'link' tag in the 'index.html' if you want to include it in other ways or use other libraries.
